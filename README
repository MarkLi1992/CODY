          CODY: Continuum Dynamics Evaluation and Test Suite
                             Version 1.0

CODY is a development framework and suite of small applications, or
"mini-apps", characteristic of continuum dynamics applications that
will be used for research in new programming models, software
environments, and the evaluation of new computer architectures.

On what platforms does it run?

CODY is initially a suite of applications written in C and C++ with
extensions -- including CUDA and OpenCL -- that enable the use of
emerging computer architectures.  Our goals are operating system,
computer architecture, and programming language agnostic, however, so
we expect evolution over time.

For whom is it designed?

CODY is designed for computer science researchers to assess and
explore new directions in computer architecture and programming
models.

Why was it developed?

CODY was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory to provide a set
of small, manageable applications that are representative of some
scientific workloads at LANL, in a form that can be readily shared
with research partners at other organizations.
